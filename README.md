Article analyzer and sense disambiguator. (chrome extension with backend support from jsp) When we search for images for a word from an article, we may not get the images corresponding to the correct meaning in that article's context. Our tool analyses the article from which the word was taken and produces the image results corresponding to the correct meaning.
